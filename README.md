## Intro to Structured Database Environments

Throughout this course, I learned how to use mySQL for data storage, manipulation and analysis. During the last two weeks, we were assigned a two-part project to demonstrate our skills in database development, data manipulation and data analysis.

--------------------------------------

### PART ONE SCENARIO

You’re working as a database administrator for Quantigration, a networking equipment manufacturer. The company has grown quickly, and it’s still figuring out its internal business processes. Customer return merchandise authorizations (RMAs) are used to track shipments for defective or incorrect parts. The company has identified RMAs as a specific problematic area.

Your supervisor at Quantigration asked you to create a database for a new software application that will be used for processing RMAs. Because there are several locations where merchandise can be taken in, the application must also record where items are received. This system will also capture where the equipment is going next: repair, scrap, or refurbishing and resale. The warehouse shipping and receiving employees at your company will be using this application; they are considered your “end users” for the application. Part of their job is to process customer return shipments. This involves the following steps:

Assess the quality of the items being returned for defects
Identify missing parts
Identify signs of obvious wear and tear (such as dents or scratches to the equipment)

The data architect on your DevOps team has come to you with a logical database diagram referred to as an entity relationship diagram (ERD). This is documentation of the tables, their relationships to each other, their attributes, and any primary or foreign keys on those attributes. These elements are required to create the new database.

---------------------------------------

### PART TWO SCENARIO

The product manager of Quantigration has asked your data analytics team for a report summarizing your analysis of the return merchandise authorizations (RMAs) that have been received. These are the same data sets that you’ve already been working with. Your report should focus on summarizing the analysis and presenting your findings to the product manager.

In your report, respond to the manager’s requests: to summarize the data you’ve been working with and to identify key information that will help the company streamline operations. Remember, not everyone who reviews this report will have a technical background.

Begin by writing SQL commands to capture usable data (which you’ve preloaded into Codio) for your analysis.
Specifically, the product manager wants you to analyze the following:
1. Analyze the number of returns by state and describe your findings in your report.
2. Analyze the percentage of returns by product type and describe your findings in your report.

In your report, clearly summarize your analysis of the data for stakeholders. Include screenshots of the results of each query. When summarizing results, you may want to consider the following questions:
- How does the data provide the product manager with usable information?
- What are the potential flaws in the data that has been presented?
- Are there any limitations on your conclusions, or any  other ways of looking at it that you haven’t considered? Clearly communicate your findings to stakeholders.
